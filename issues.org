#+title: Issues
* Common Issues I had
** Didn't know how to update my system using this config
1. run =nix flake update= to get the new flake.lock
   + this is important as this updates the version of nixpkgs (the package repo) which you use when rebuilding
2. run =sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade --flake .# --impure=
   + this is just the normal rebuild command
